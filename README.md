# Eat-Da-Burger
Burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

This site is deployed on heroku ([live here!](https://boiling-eyrie-19832.herokuapp.com/)) and makes
use of the [jawsdb mysql](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/jawsdb) plugin to connect to, add to, and update database elements.

## Node included Resources:
- [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
